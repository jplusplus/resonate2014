"\t\t\t<p>They do not call themselves ‘artists’, but their creations "
"mesmerize and challenge passers-by. They are shun by traditional auction "
"houses and most museums, but might be the future of art. We met the new-"
"media art scene in Belgrade last week, at the Resonate festival.</p>\n"
"\n"
"\t\t\t<p>Belgrade has been announced to us as the new Berlin. Serbia was "
"hit hard by the financial crisis. That’s the first thing locals mention. "
"Berlin’s flamboyant mayor Klaus Wowereit is notoriously close to his "
"city’s cultural class. Dragan Đilas, Belgrade’s mayor until late 2013, is"
" a mass media mogul, who has brought Big Brother to Serbia. Performance "
"artist Marina Abramović, who exposed at the New-York Guggenheim and works"
" with Lady Gaga, is from Belgrade. The Museum of Contemporary Arts "
"collection holds works by Salvador Dalí, Andy Warhol, George Maciunas and"
" Hannah Wilke. When it opened in 1958 it was one of Europe’s first "
"national museums of modern art. Since it closed for renovation works in "
"2007 it has been slowly transforming into a ruin. Government funding has "
"run out.</p>\n"
"\n"
"\t\t\t<p>Belgrade is setting out to fulfill the “poor, but sexy” promise,"
" that Wowereit famously made about Berlin a decade ago. A young "
"generation of artists is bringing the city to the center stage of the art"
" scene. Its cheap rents are turning it into a safe haven for creative "
"types. In <a href=\"http://www.mercer.de/press-releases/1420615\" "
"target=\"_blank\">cost of living surveys</a> Belgrade regularly ranks far"
" better than Berlin or other cities famous for their bohemian scenes such"
" as Portland or Istanbul.</p>\n"
"\n"
"\t\t\t<p>Concept stores, galleries, coworking spaces and creative "
"agencies are popping up all over the old centre along the banks of the "
"Sava River and towards the Danube. Artists, tinkerers and hackers are at "
"the forefront of this development. Milos Rancic, the founder of Hacklab "
"Belgrade on the borders of the city centre, thinks young Serbs’ taste for"
" computer code goes back to inventor and futurist Nikola Tesla. Rancic "
"has been working on free software projects for over a decade. “People "
"aspire to be as inventive with electronics as Tesla”, he says as he takes"
" a sip of his energy drink and lights another Davidoff cigarette.</p>\n"

"\t\t\t<p>Space not taken up by laptops is covered with cables, duct tape,"

"through narrow staircases filled with smoothie-fueled chatter. A mix of "
"games, performances, data visualizations, interactive installations and "
"artificial intelligence projects is presented in front of bulging lecture"
" theatres. The digital arts circus has put up its tents in Belgrade. It’s"
" the first day of Resonate festival.\n"
"\t\t\t</p>\n"
"\t\t\t<p>\n"
"\t\t\tSome participants have already arrived a couple of days before the "
"official launch of the festival. They’ve been trading insights in "
"workshops on coding with light, face manipulation, or specific frameworks"
" for algorithmic art. They often know each other from previous "
"collaborations or hackathons that rarely last longer than a couple of "
"days. The new-media art community is small. Few coders work with the "
"software tools these artists develop. Programming environments like "
"OpenFrameworks, Cinder and vvvv are exotic concepts even for regular "
"programmers. At Resonate festival they are omnipresent. Artists use them "
"to control light, sound, visual elements on screen and program "
"interactions involving the audience or physical objects. Many manipulate "
"so called Arduinos, mini-controllers that transform inputs from sensors "
"into outputs to lamps, motors or musical instruments.\t\n"

"\t\t\t<p>There’s a video that participants routinely refer to, in which "
"the Japanese artist Daito Manabe makes his face dance to music. Manabe’s "
"goal is to create a device that automatically transmits the expression of"
" one face onto another. For one of the early test performances Manabe "
"sticks myoelectric sensors, usually used for medical examinations, and "
"uses electric impulse generators to make his facial muscles move to "
"music.</p>\n"

"\t\t\t<p>Technological advances and the creation of new devices "
"constantly change the way new-media artists work. They provide them with "
"new physical and digital materials and create the social shifts their "
"work reflects. Google Glass is ostensively absent at Resonate festival "
"and speakers at panels loathe its privacy infringing features. But most "
"new-media artists are obsessed with data. The more sensors collect, the "
"more raw material for data-based art. Some run apps on their phones which"
" meticulously measure every step they make. Graphic designer Nicholas "
"Felton even publishes ‘Personal Annual Reports’ that reflect his life in "
"charts and visualize his daily routines.</p>\n"

"\t\t\t<p>The default behaviour of many new-media artists is open source. "
"That means that they often share the code of their art works with the "
"public and allow people to build upon it - often before completion "
"itself. They rely on programming languages and environments that are "
"collectively developed. Resonate festival is not an exhibition or an art "
"fair. Its open format, discussions and space for creation rather "
"resembles a university.</p>\n"
"\n"
"\t\t\t<p>Kyle McDonald, Daito Manabe, and Klaus Obermaier sit on stage "
"behind a table that looks as if it was build out of gigantic wooden "
"bricks. The three artists have just finished their collaboration on a "
"code-based performance piece they have called ‘Transcranial’. It mixes "
"dancing, distortion of filmed body parts, and Manabe’s notorious electric"
" impulses on the performer's face. They show fragments that have inspired"
" their work, such as a <a "
